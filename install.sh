# Why this exists rather than `make install`: that target is Linux's — it drops a
# bare binary in ~/.local/bin next to a .desktop entry. On macOS a bare binary
# has no Info.plist, no icon and no bundle identifier, and the identifier is not
# cosmetic here: the Keychain keys its ACLs off code identity, and this app
# keeps its signing key there. A bundle-less install is not a lesser install, it
# is a different app to the OS.
